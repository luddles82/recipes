Power Oatmeal

Ingredients:

1 ripe banana, mashed (the more ripe/spotty the better)
2 tablespoons chia seeds
heaping 1/3 cup rolled oats (use certified gluten-free if necessary)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2/3 cup almond milk
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon ground flax (optional, see note)
For garnish: soaked almonds, pepita seeds, hemp hearts, cinnamon, toasted coconut, nut butter, spices (cinnamon, ginger, allspice)

Directions:

The night before: Grab a medium bowl and mash the banana until smooth. Now stir in the chia, oats, cinnamon, milk, and water until combined. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning: Scoop the oat mixture into a medium pot. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat immediately to medium-low, and stir frequently until heated throughout and thickened. At the end of cooking, stir in flax (optional).
Pour oats into bowl. Garnish with your desired toppings. Get cozy!
